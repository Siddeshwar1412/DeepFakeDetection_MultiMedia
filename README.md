# DeepFakeDetection_MultiMedia

## **Deepfake Detection System: A Multi-Modal Deep Learning Approach**

### **Overview**
This project leverages deep learning techniques to detect deepfake content across multiple media types: **images, audio, and video**.  

Deepfake detection refers to identifying manipulated media that has been artificially created or altered using advanced artificial intelligence techniques. As deepfake technology continues to evolve, the need for reliable, automated detection becomes increasingly critical.

This system integrates multiple deep learning models to classify media as **real or fake**, helping to combat misinformation, identity theft, and other harmful uses of synthetic media.

## **Project Structure**
The project consists of a **frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)** and a **backend (Flask, TensorFlow, PyTorch)** that work together seamlessly.  

The **frontend** allows users to upload images, audio, or video files, which are then processed by the **backend** using deep learning models. The backend processes these files and sends the results back to the frontend for display.

### **Key Components**
- **Frontend**: Provides an interactive interface for uploading media files and viewing results.
- **Backend**: Hosts the deep learning models for detecting deepfakes, handles file uploads, and processes predictions.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Separate models for detecting deepfakes in images, audio, and video.

## **Models Used**

### **1. Image Detection Model (CNN - PyTorch)**
- **Description**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) processes images to detect subtle visual artifacts introduced during manipulation.
- **Preprocessing**:  
  - Images are resized, normalized, and optionally converted to a different color space to highlight manipulation artifacts.
- **Framework**: PyTorch

### **2. Image Classification Model (PyTorch)**
- **Description**: A separate classification model that further analyzes detected fake images for classification.
- **Framework**: PyTorch

### **3. Audio Detection Model (CNN - TensorFlow)**
- **Description**: A CNN model trained to detect fake audio by analyzing the **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)**, which capture the frequency characteristics of audio signals.
- **Preprocessing**:  
  - Audio files are resampled, split into frames, and converted into MFCC features for the model.
- **Framework**: TensorFlow

## **Core Technologies**
- **TensorFlow & Keras**: Used for training and deploying the audio deep learning model.
- **PyTorch**: Used for building, training, and deploying the image detection and classification models.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for handling HTTP requests, file uploads, and response generation.
- **OpenCV**: Used for image pre-processing, including resizing and color space conversion.
- **LibROSA**: Used for audio processing tasks, including resampling and feature extraction (MFCCs).
- **JavaScript**: Enhances user experience with real-time updates, file validation, and AJAX requests for asynchronous communication with the backend.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Provides a responsive, modern design for the frontend interface.

---

## **Workflow**
1. **Frontend**: The user uploads an image, audio, or video file through the web interface.
2. **Backend**: The file is sent to the Flask backend, where it is processed:  
   - **Image**: Passed through a CNN (PyTorch) to detect visual anomalies.  
   - **Audio**: Processed for MFCCs and fed into a CNN (TensorFlow) for classification.  
3. **Prediction**: The model generates a prediction (**Real or Fake**) and sends it back to the frontend.
4. **Result Display**: The frontend dynamically updates to show the detection result.

---

## **File Validation and Processing**
- **Frontend**: Ensures only valid file formats are uploaded (**JPG, PNG, MP3, etc.**).
- **Backend**: Converts media to the required format before processing:  
  - **Images**: Converted to **JPG**.  
  - **Audio**: Converted to **MP3**.  

---

## **Error Handling**
Both frontend and backend have error-handling mechanisms:

### **Frontend**
- Alerts the user for invalid file types, missing files, or failed uploads.

### **Backend**
- Catches issues like missing files, model errors, and unsupported media types.
- Returns relevant error codes (**e.g., 400, 415**).
